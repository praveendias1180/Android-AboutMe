    <string name="bio">Hi, my name is Praveen.I love programming.

    \n\nI can develop Android Applications with Kotlin.

    \n\nI am experienced in PHP and Javascript-related web development technologies. You may see my portfolio on my website. My current scope of work involves PHP and Javascript development.

    \n\nMy clients and employees are genuinely happy with the value I am adding to their lives as a developer. Their positive feedback keeps me satisfied and encourages me to deliver even more value to them. I take my work seriously and strive to realize the best of myself as a developer or programmer. To this date, the negative feedback I got from my clients and employees is very rare. (Yes, there were some incidents, get in touch with me to know more; praveen@range.quest)

    \n\nFor most people, computer programming does not sound very interesting. For me, programming and development is a passion I have been chasing for over 15 years. Most recently, my work landed me on Range Quest where I am focused on PHP, Javascript, and React. I guess you could say I am living the dream.</string>
